## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me

```yaml
name: Aruntej
located_in: Hyderabad, India
education:
  - "Self-Taught Developer and Designer"
  - "Bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering"
```

### 🌱 Who I Am

I'm a self-driven Computer Science Engineering graduate who enjoys turning ideas into functional, scalable software. My journey started with curiosity and grew through hands-on building — from backend systems to full-stack applications and now into AI-powered solutions.

I strongly believe in **learning by doing**. Whether it's experimenting with new frameworks, breaking things to understand them better, or rebuilding systems more efficiently, I enjoy the process as much as the result.

### 🎯 What I'm Passionate About

- Designing clean APIs and backend architectures
- Exploring AI, LLMs, and agent-based workflows
- Building systems that are practical, scalable, and user-focused
- Working in fast-paced environments where learning never stops
